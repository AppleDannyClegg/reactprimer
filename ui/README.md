# React Primer 


## Running in dev mode

Open two terminal windows on WSL

Go into the api directory

``` 
cd ./ui
npm i
npm run dev

```

Go back to the root

``` 
cd ../
```

Then go into the ui directory

```
cd ./ui
npm i
npm run dev
```

This should open a browser window and the app should be running. 

## Possible issues

The api runs on port 3000 and the UI used 5173 is these ports are in use the solution will fail to run.
